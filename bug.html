This bug occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or has a typo.  For example:

```html
<div class="@apply bg-blue-500 text-center">
  Hello, world!
</div>
```

If `bg-blue-500` or `text-center` are mistyped or removed from your `tailwind.config.js`'s `content` array, Tailwind will not apply the styles, resulting in unexpected visual output (no background color or incorrect text alignment).
