To fix this, ensure that all classes used within the `@apply` directive are correctly spelled and included in the `content` array within your `tailwind.config.js` file.  For example:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./bug.html" ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Make sure that the `./bug.html` path is correct. And the HTML should be:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-center">
  Hello, world!
</div>
```

This version uses the standard classes directly and will work as expected.
